This is just a sample of using QTableWidget to create a spreadsheet on a custom user interface.  I extended the QTableWidget key press functionality
to allow for being able to highlight and copy/paste cells properly into say Excel.  Also allows for dynamically adding/creating columns/rows with data and making the spreadsheet looks decent.  It also has clicked connect functionality so that when a cell is clicked, it returns the value of the cell, which is useful for example if you want to use that to find data about that item in a database somewhere.
